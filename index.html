                <p><u><b>GROUP PROCESSES</b></u></p>
				<p><u>How well did the group work together in Assignment 2?</u></p>
             	<p>Our group worked extremely well in Assignment 2. We had no issues with other team members, as we were all happy in doing our part. We kept in constant communication with other members, and were happy to attend all meetings.</p>
				<br>
				<p><u>Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?</u></p>
				<p>Based on how well we worked in Assignment 2, we feel that we don't have to introduce any changes, except we should continue to work as efficiently as we did in the last assignment.</p>
				<br>
				
                <p><u><b>IDEAL JOBS</b></u></p>
                <p><u>Our ideal jobs:</u></p>
                <li>Michael: Java Software Developer</li>
                <li>Joshua: Security Engineer / Network Administrator</li>
                <li>Chathura: iOS Developer</li>
                <li>Kavishka: Data Analyst</li>
                <br>
                <p><u>Compare and contrast ideal jobs:</u></p>
                <li>What common elements are there, if any?</li>
                <br>
                <p>All of our ideal jobs require some form of technical skills. While the demand for our ideal jobs certainly vary, there is still going to be demand for all our jobs (as IT as a whole is only going to continue to have increased demand). All of our jobs will require core skills such as communication and team work, and you will need to pay attention to detail and also have good problem-solving skills.</p>
                <li>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</li>
                <br>
                <p>There are a few key things that differentiate each position from another. Some of these include salary, working hours, and also the working environment. Data Analyst is the job that differentiates most from the others, as the others are mainly based on development using programming, whereas as a Data Analyst job manily consists of manipulating data to indentify patterns and trends. </p>
                <li>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</li>
                <br>
                <p>All of our career plans are IT related, but as said above, there are a few differences between jobs that easily distinguish each of the jobs from others. The two most similar jobs would be Java Developer and Mobile Application Developer, as they are both massively programming based, and will involve developing software for users.

				<p><u>Assignment 2 Website:</u> <a href="https://assignment2group8.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">https://assignment2group8.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a></p>
				<p><u>GitHub:</u> <a href="https://github.com/s3839996/iit-assignment3">https://github.com/s3839996/iit-assignment3</a></p>
				<p><u>How well does the Git repository reflect our group's work?</u></p>
				<p>In comparison to assignment 2, our group put a lot more effort into making more frequent commitments to the GitHub repository (across all members). Rather than doing our work in a shared document (like in Assignment 2), we each did our work in separate documents, and we committed our work when there were significant changes. We also made more commitments whenever there were changes to the website HTML files, ensuring that we had several backups in the event of any issues. So because of these reasons, we feel that the repository most definitely accurately reflected our group work, and we feel that Git is an extremely important tool to use in any project or assignment.</p>
