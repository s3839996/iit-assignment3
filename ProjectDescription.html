                <p>Reduce unnecessary trips to the GP and hospital by helping clients diagnose their health issue on the basis of the symptoms and family background history through the use of an online tool.</p>
				<p><b>Goal 1:</b> Utilise, process and breakdown raw data on previous anonymous data on heath diagnosis.</p>
				<li>Raw data on previous health diagnoses and other data will have to be analysed and linked up with its common symptoms, and then to the medical condition they are related with.</li>
				<br>
				<p><b>Goal 2:</b>  Developing an interface that is user friendly to people of various technical and health knowledge.</p>
				<li>To achieve this goal will require firsthand experience in both using and developing UI designs for both web and mobile.</li>
				<br>
				<p><b>Goal 3:</b> Developing a system which can handle various issues, symptoms and family background history which is then analysed and returns a possible health diagnosis.</p>
				<li>The teams knowledge of databases and programming will be helpful in assisting the ability to link up data, and turn the raw data into information.</li>
                <br>

                <h2 id="yeet2"><b>PLANS AND PROGRESS</b></h2>
                <p>Our project is a health issue prediction tool which will be developed as a web-based application. Major parts of this application would be based off artificial intelligence learning and data mining.  </p>
				<p>We had the idea to create a health issue prediction tool after seeing how much misinformation there is online. Many people go online to search up symptoms they may have a hard time trying to find out what the cause may be, but there is lots of inaccurate information which is provided by people who are not medical professionals. By creating this health issue prediction tool based off of science, and with the help of medical professionals, we would be able to ensure that people have the best information available to them.  </p>
				<p>We identified the stakeholders during the analysis stage of the project. We did this in order to identify our target users so we could then create personas (such as a young user, mid aged user, and elderly user, user without IT knowledge, etc.). By knowing our target users, we can identify what elements need to be incorporated and excluded from the project. For example, if we identify a 20 year old female who uses technology regularly and is able to learn now systems easily (assuming they are user friendly) we can then test the application during various stages to see how that user would ideally interact with the system. From there, we can determine if something is too complicated or confusing, as well as identifying what works well. </p>
				<p>In addition to identifying the stakeholders we planned to create context diagrams which relate to the stakeholders and how they would interact with the application, data flow diagrams to identify what data the application would be processing, such as recent blood test information, body temperature, etc. The data flow diagrams determine where data will go and how it will be used by both the user and the system. To further identify inputs and outputs we wanted to create an IPO chart to show how inputs from users will be processed and how they will then be shown back to the user. An example is a user entering their temperature e.g. 38&deg;C, an IPO chart will show the developers how that data goes from &apos;38&deg;C&apos; into a suggestion that they may have a high fever, the process demonstrates how the system determines that answer. /p>
				<p>When creating the timeframe for this project we decided that a large amount of time should be given for the development of the application, considering the complexity of it. We also assumed that beta testing would take up to a week or possibly longer considering all of the features the application has and having to check that all the information entered and provided is correct. In addition, basic testing would also be taking place during the development stage. Finally, we decided to leave a few days prior to releasing the application to the public for fixing any small bugs discovered during beta testing. Even though our developers could continue working on the system design indefinitely, we had to stick with our deadlines and ensure that the specified sections of the website were working before beta testing began. </p>
				<p>After hiring of the required personnel is completed, we would need to assign roles to those employees. We would consider the skills of each employee to determine where in the team they would be working. As a team we would want to provide new employees with the opportunity to expand their skills by exposing them to new technologies and people. Making the employees work out of their comfort zone will also give them the opportunity to grow as a team member. This could include being responsible for various aspects of tasks and possibly managing small or medium sized teams.  </p>
				<p>To ensure that employees are working at their best we could offer some perks such as having flexible work hours and be given the choice of working from home on some days. This type of workplace strategy can increase the number of applicants with required skills. As we will require employees with advanced skills and experience it is likely that the cost of salary will also become a major constraint for this project. </p>
				<p>As this project depends on various people working in vastly different fields it will be important to have regular meetings to ensure everyone is up to date with their tasks and know where the entire group is at. If employees are given the option of working from home or having flexible hours this could require more time management skills to find a time where all employees are available.  </p>
				<p>Throughout the weeks of our team working on the project it is important to keep team morale high to ensure we can deliver a product that is high standard but is also completed on time. To ensure this there should be frequent group gatherings outside of work which will include Friday drinks at the local pub or doing other activities outside of work. </p>
				<p>The funding of this project will affect how employees can work, and what technologies we can use to develop the project. Time is also a constraint as the team will only have a specific amount of time to develop a very complex application. Therefore, we decided to not include some features such as My Health Record linking feature which would allow users to link their My Health Record data with their online accounts for the health issue prediction tool.  </p>
				<p>We completed all tasks in the timeframe up to the 31st May 2020, which include discussing the timeline for the entire project, the scope and limits of the application, and the project description. The initial stages of our project will be completed by us, such as the project description, and the roles required. Then we will have a third-party developer work with us to develop the health issue prediction tool.  </p>

				<h2 id="yeet3"><b>ROLES</b></h2>
                <p><u><b>UX experience and front end builder - Chathura</b></u></p>
                <p>Chathura&apos;s experience in designing user friendly and efficient applications, provides the user with a way to easily interact with their devices. His experience includes designing a custom-built website for his RMIT assignments as well as designing and building iOS interfaces by utilising tools such as XCode story board. The UX is at the up most importance to the success of this application due to its interaction with various types of people. </p>
				
                <br>
				
				<p><u><b>Lead Data Scientist - Kavishka</b></u></p>
				<p>Kavishka will be leading the role of the data scientist. His interest in data and databases has led him to decide to major in data management for IT degree. The collection, analysis and processing of raw data is the backbone of this application. This is to ensure that accurate data is presented to the end user. Data is a core part of the development of this application; hence, Data Scientist should be its own exclusive role.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><u><b>Back End Developer - Michael Schirmacher</b></u></p>
				<p>Michael Schirmacher will be taking the role of the back end developer. THis is a vital role as the development of the application would require everything from the user interface to data manipulation. Michael will suit this role as he has vast experience in developing web apps and traditional apps through Java and HTML.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><u><b>Project Manager - Joshua</b></u></p>
				<p>The role of project manager includes the duty of planning, overseeing, and leading projects, thus ensure that a certain project is completed to a high standard -> meeting certain limits such as time and resources. This role also includes communication with HR and other stakeholders, to make sure that they are aware of the projects current progress. Josh was initially reluctant to take on this role, but with a bit of encouragement and having been nominated by his team, Josh decided to take on the role.</p>
				
				
				
				<h2 id="yeet4"><b>SCOPE AND LIMITS</b></h2>
				<p><u><b>Scope</b></u></p>
                <p>A major feature of the development of this application includes its ability to receive an input from the user about their symptoms and family history. This is the most important part, as it will help to determine the possible medical condition, thus, it is crucial that this part is fully developed and also tested. This ensures that the service is fully functional and accurate. As the development of this feature will take the most time, it is not feasible to add other features such as extracting data from other services such as myHealthRecord.</p>
                <br>
				<p><b><u>Limits and Constraints</u></b></p>
				<p><u>Economic Constraints</u></p>
				<li><b>Cost: </b>As this might be a start-up company, the cost of employees and IT equipment would be a limiting factor.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Time: </b>Even though more employees means that the project might be able to finish earlier, it also increases the cost. But at the same time, the process of building a database, processing and manipulating data, as well as testing, takes a lot of time and resources.</li>
				<br>
				
				<p><u>Technical Constraints</u></p>
				<li><b>Speed of processing: </b>The solution should be hosted on a server that has at least 6 cores of processing power and 16gb of ram. The network should also be able to maintain a high upload and download speed.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Availability of equipment and services: </b>The location of the database and server could result in it not getting access to the highest network speed, due to availability and demand. Also, some network and computers could not be available due to supply/demand issues, or due to inflated prices.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Security: </b>The solution should be able to verify users through a system like myGov, such as autofilling data from a service like myHealthRecord.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Compatibility: </b>The solution should be designed as being able to run on different platforms, screen sizes, and resolutions. The may be hindered by either technical expertise, time, or cost constraints.</li>
				<br>
				
				<p><u>Social Constraints</u></p>
				<li><b>Level of expertise amongst users: </b>Some users of the service may be adults with no technical expertise or knowledge of health-related forms. So its important to cater the solution to users of all technical abilities.</li>
				<br>
				
				<p><u>Legal Constraints</u></p>
				<li><b>Privacy: </b>Any data collected or processed should not breach local or forge on privacy laws. In regards to local laws, the service provided must not breach the Privacy Act 1988, Health Record Act 2001, and the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Ownership: </b>The product will be owned by the compant developing the service but this also means that there will be legal hurdles, such as filing patents and enforcing copyright. This would also bring responsibilities for any mistakes or errors in the future.</li>
				<br>
				
				<p><u>Usability Constraints</u></p>
				<li><b>Accessiblity: </b>People who may have a disability hindering them from utilising the service to the full extent. For example, if a user has a visual disability, the website may need to adapt by increasing font sizes or having a voice over function.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Ease of use: </b>The solution should be easy to navigate and learn. Hence, the application should be able to provide hints and tips along the way. But, it should also be designed in a way where the user can reasonably move throughout different parts of the service without any help.</li>
				<br>
				
				<h2 id="yeet5"><b>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</b></h2>
                <p><u><b>What software or other tools are required by the project?</b></u></p>
				
				<p><u>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</u></p>

                <br>
				<br>
				
				<p><u><b>Prior group experience with tools and technologies:</b></u></p>
				<p>In terms of what experience our group has had with some of these tools and technologies, we have all used majority of the ones listed. GitHub is one that we&apos;re currently using at the moment, along with HTML development (using Notepad ++). None of us have used JavaScript before, but some of us have used NetBeans and Visual Studio, mainly programming in Java. We have also all used Microsoft Teams, as well as using Dropbox. Only one of us use macOS on a regular basis, whereas the rest of us use Windows, and we have also all been exposed to hardware such as hard drives. </p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2 id="yeet6"><b>TESTING</b></h2>
                <p>To ensure that the application performs as expected, its important to develop a variety of tests. These tests can be specific to a particular function, such as returning a predicted health issue based on symptoms that are the most probable for that illness. As the application heavily relies on data, particularly the relationships between data, to find correlations and patterns to determine which symptoms are the most common for which particular disease, whilst also factoring in other variables such as age and gender. It&apos;s important to note that data cannot always be 100% accurate; correlation does not mean causation, but the application can still attempt to provide the most probable prediction by analysing the data available.</p>
				<p>An effective method to test the program could be to provide a prototype to individuals who do suffer from some kind of disease or illness, ask them to take note of their symptoms and personal information (age, gender), and compare their actual disease with the predicted one. If their actual disease was part of the predicted list (perhaps there could be a percentage probability for several diseases) and its high up on the list, then that could be considered a success. As is with any project, the most important person is the end user, so its important to allow them to test the application instead of just the developers. </p>
                <br>
				
				<h2 id="yeet7"><b>TIMEFRAME</b></h2>
                <p><img src="https://gr8assignment3.s3.amazonaws.com/timeframe.png"></p>
                <br>
				
				<h2 id="yeet8"><b>RISKS</b></h2>
                <p>No matter how well you think you&apos;ve planned a project, anything can go wrong and the entire project can run into problems. So, when a project is being planned, its important to identity possible risks and implement possible plans for when you have to deal with these risks. Risks can fall into several categories such as <b>cost / financial, technical, people</b>, and even in some cases the <b>client</b>. </p>
				<p>In relation to our project idea, our web-based application requires a range of software tools as outlined in <a href="https://gr8assignment3.s3.amazonaws.com/ProjectDescription.html#yeet5" style="color:;">Tools and Technologies</a>, and these each come with their associated risks. </p>
				<p>The fact that our project&apos;s main function is to give people an accurate and reliable assessment of possible health conditions that they may have. This in itself is a major risk, as giving a completely incorrect result could have severe effects on the <b>client</b> (the user), including shock and anxiety from an incorrect prediction, which could then result in <b>backlash</b> on the business / developers.</p>
				<p>In order for our application to give accurate and reliable predictions, it needs to have access to data and statistics for the majority of known health conditions, illnesses, and diseases. This can be risky, as not only will this most likely be very <b>expensive</b> to access, but it will also need to be updated on a regular basis to account for new diseases. </p>
				<p>Databases will play a major role in the success of our application, but unfortunately, maintaining the integrity of these databases can be difficult in some cases. This can be several reasons, ranging from the difficulty to learn the software / programming languages, and ensuring that <b>people</b> (employees) have the <b>skills</b> to operate / manage such a database, which can result in a non-functional application. </p>
				<p>As the user will be required to enter some personal information, such as age, sex, and any other past health conditions, as well as other optional information, this can result in <b>legal</b> risks, as the developers need to ensure that the privacy and security of the confidential information is of a high standard and obeys <b>regulations</b>. </p>
				<p><b>Schedule risks</b> are another common risk in many projects, and ours is no exception. Some activities may very well take longer than we predicted on our <a href="https://gr8assignment3.s3.amazonaws.com/ProjectDescription.html#yeet7" style="color:;">Timeframe</a>, and this can result in many other risk factors becoming a possibility, including increased cost. If the project has a deadline and scheduling becomes an issue, then this could result in a <b>performance risk</b> as the application may fail to produce the results that were outlined in the specifications / requirements. </p>
                <br>
				
				<h2 id="yeet9"><b>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATIONS</b></h2>
                <p>Communication is something that is critical to ensure a successful project, both in the end product and throughout its development cycle. With todays technology, its easier than ever to keep all project members &apos;in the loop&apos;, ranging from emails, online meetings, databases and other websites. It&apos;s not only important for the project team to stay in constant communication, its also so that the client is able to put forwards their decisions easily, and that these decisions can be easily accessed by all the members of the development team. Any communication between members that is not formally recorded can be captured in the form of recorded calls, messages / emails or even status reports. For communication to have a positive impact on any project, it needs to be frequently, so it would be wise for a team to meet several times a week, much like what our group has been doing throughout this assignment (meeting through Microsoft Teams). In the situation that a group member was unable to attend a scheduled meeting, they should be provided with any notes taken throughout the meeting, and should be given an updated status report. Thankfully, throughout our assignments, we have stayed in frequent communication and all of us have attended every meeting, and each member reponded quickly to any messages sent.</p>
                <br>
				
				<h2 id="yeet10"><b>SKILLS AND JOBS</b></h2>                
                <p>To begin development of our project, it will be essential to hire new staff with a range of technical expertise in various industries. So, what kind of skills should we be looking for when we hire someone? Well, as outlined in the <a href="https://gr8assignment3.s3.amazonaws.com/ProjectDescription.html#yeet3" style="color:;">Roles</a> section, we can advertise for several positions which would be essential in the development of our application. </p>
				<p>Firstly, the application will be web-based, so having a back-end developer with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is most definitely a must. This developer will need to have experience in working in a team, and will need to have thorough problem solving and communication skills.</p>
				<p>Secondly, the application will need to be user-friendly (in terms of the design). So, it will be essential to hire a UX / front-end builder. This designer will need to have extensive creativity skills, as well as having innovative thinking, and should be able to present a portfolio of their past design, as well as good communication skills.</p>
				<p>Thirdly, the application revolves heavily around the use of data. So, in order to process and manipulate that data, it would be very important to hire a Data Analyst, who would need to have experience in using various tools to collect data, but also have the ability to analyse data and identify common trends and patterns. This person would also need to have high competencies in verbal and visual communication to express and clarify data to their team members. </p>
				<p>Finally, to ensure that development of the application runs smoothly, a project manager is another must. They will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the project, scheduling check-ups / meetings, and ensuring that the project is running within the time and cost constraints. A project manager&apos;s most valuable skills to have it communication, but they should also have experience in using common management programs and software, and should be comfortable in working in larger teams. </p>
