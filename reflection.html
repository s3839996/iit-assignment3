                <h2><b>GROUP REFLECTION</b></h2>
                <p><b><u>Individual Reflections</u></b></p>
				<br>

                <p><u>Michael:</u> Much like Assignment 2, I really enjoyed working with the team. We kept in constant communication through MS Teamns, and everyone did their part to contribute to the assignment workload. Everyone worked hard on their assigned work, and tried their best to make it as high quality as possible. By working in groups, I was surprised by how easy it was to ask for help, but also how much the stress was lowered by having others there to help you at any time. I think its very useful having other people to talk to, as you're able to get advice or a second opinion. In terms of GitHub, we made frequent commitments, including our individual work documents and the HTML files. This proved to be quite useful as it allowed us to backtrack in cases of errors, and which we could then upload them directly to AWS.</p>
				<br>
				
                <p><u>Joshua:</u> It seems that Ivan&apos;s match making skills are very good as the group has always worked very well together. We regularly had team meetings and discussed our progress. Whenever someone needed help or was stuck on a part of their assignment, we all helped. I think the team could have worked even more efficiently if we could have met in person, but we could not do that.  Everyone was very dedicated to their work and I learned that my group is very hard working and by working together in a group we can complete the assignment. Everyone added their own work to the GitHub repository regularly, so I do think it shows how everyone did their part, but I do not think generally GitHub is the most effective tool for word documents.  </p>
				<br>
				
                <p><u>Chathura:</u> During the time I spent working with the group, I am pleased to say that I enjoyed working with my fellow members. Every member in the group was very productive with the work they were assigned, and they were always there to help me when required and we all had a fair say on what the project idea was going to be, as well as choosing the parts of the assignment that each member was going to do. Ivan did a good job at picking our members, and I have made friends with the members. It is good to work in groups as I am able to get a second opinion and am able to discuss the assignment. Using GitHub was easy, and everyone committed to it, so I think it does accurately show the work that was done by the group</p>
				<br>
				
                <p><u>Kavishka:</u> We did a very good group task because everyone in the group was in a constant communication via MS Teams. I could say the way of allocation group members to each section is very admirable. Each IT experts choose their professionalism towards their selected sections. Since the better time management, we could be able to accomplish this assignment before the deadline. Everyone helped each other when someone was struggling with his things to do. Contribution to the GitHub repository is well done because everyone has a better awareness of it. </p>
				<br>

                <p><b><u>Combined Reflection</u></b></p>
                <p>When looking at our teams work during the assignment, we all think that we worked very well together. We were always available to help each other and regularly discussed our progress during our scheduled meetings. Just like assignment two each of the team members assigned each other a part of the assignment and everyone was happy to do the parts they chose. Each one of our members has a skill which was essential in making our teams work efficient. Michael knows how to use GitHub and set up the repository for our team. He also knows HTML, so he helped out the group with writing it and took the lead role of managing the HTML code. Chathura helped with the website template used from assignment two, and completing the roles, scope, and limit part of the assignment. As Joshua wrote the project description for assignment two he chose to continue with that task, making sure he continued to refine and add more information into the project description after reading the feedback from Ivan and from the teams discussion with Isaac Balbin. Kavishka chose to complete the skills and jobs section and the overview for the project idea of the assignment. </p>
				<p>As soon as the GitHub was set up, we were constantly making sure to commit any updates we made to make sure that our teammates could see the latest versions of our work. Every time someone completed a part of the assignment, we all reviewed it and gave some feedback, no one was offended by the suggestions or changes made and instead took it as an opportunity to improve the detail of their work.  </p>
				<p>All of the team&apos;s formal meetings were organised by the team together to decide a time appropriate for everyone, and then the team was scheduled and recorded using Microsoft Teams by Joshua. We continued to use the same Microsoft Team that we setup for assignment two and where therefore immediately were communicating with each other very often. </p>
